            <p>Welcome to the 2025 dynasty rookie draft guide tailored for your 12-team, head-to-head PPR IDP league. This guide focuses on top rookies across offense and defense, considering your superflex-capable setup (with OP allowing a second QB) and detailed IDP scoring that rewards tackles, sacks, interceptions, and more. Profiles are styled like last year's example, highlighting key prospects ranked by projected dynasty value (blending talent, landing spot, and opportunity). I've prioritized high-upside players for your deep 40-man rosters and 36 keepers.</p>
            
            <p>Rookies are evaluated post-2025 NFL Draft, with emphasis on immediate impact and long-term potential in PPR (1 pt/rec) and IDP formats. Use this for your offline rookie draft on July 26, 2025—focus on QBs/RBs/WRs/TEs early, then IDPs for depth.</p>

            <h2>Draft Strategy Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Superflex Priority:</strong> Target QBs like Dart (#1 QB), Ward (#2 QB), or Shough (upside) for superflex value</li>
                <li><strong>PPR Workhorses:</strong> RBs like Jeanty offer consistent PPR production</li>
                <li><strong>IDP Value:</strong> Grab edge rushers like Carter or DTs like Graham mid-draft (3.5 pts per half-sack)</li>
                <li><strong>TE Flex:</strong> TEs like Loveland provide solid flex utility in deeper leagues</li>
                <li><strong>Sleepers:</strong> Quinshon Judkins (RB, Browns), Emeka Egbuka (WR, Buccaneers), Jihaad Campbell (LB, Saints)</li>
